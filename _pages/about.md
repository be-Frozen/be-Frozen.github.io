# üí° Research Background

**Mini-Cloud Resource Managing System Development**, *Jul. 2023 - Aug. 2023*

*Online Project-based Learning (PBL), Interdisciplinary Research*

*Participant, Co-supervised by Prof. Maheswaran (McGill University) and Prof. Franchitti (New York University)*

- Reviewed extensive journal publications concerning Docker container concepts and familiarized myself with the fundamental concepts such as instantiation and management;

- Created and managed a mini-cloud resource manager containing 8 containers to process extensive datasets exceeding 1,000,000 records in cloud computing environments;

- Incorporated TensorFlow machine learning libraries into the derived system noted above to enable linear regressionmodeling on sample datasets.

**Automated Hierarchical Object Detection Method for Fine Annotation of Subcomponents**, *Sept. 2022 - Mar. 2023* 

*Nanjing Normal University*

*Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Fengyi Song*

- Reviewed extensive hierarchical object detection papers;

- Built a deep-learning model (based on Faster RCNN) that analyzes hierarchical relationships between data of objects for object detection and evaluated the model‚Äôs performance using our physics experiment dataset;

- Optimized the model and reduced missed detections and false alarms for small objects by 7% percent;

- Assessed the model‚Äôs performance (including latency, mAP, Quality of Experience, etc.) for small object detection.

**Interactive Visualization of Biomedical Data in both Immersive Environment & Extended Reality (XR)**, *Oct. 2021 - Sept. 2022*

*Data-Driven XR Visualization Group, Nanjing Normal University* 

*Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Richen Liu*

- Developed an immersive platform (in virtual reality) for medical diagnostics and transformed computerized topography inspection reports into 3D medical volume data. 

- Implemented advanced gesture-recognition technology to the project and realized touchless control of both angles and locations of volumetric medical data for viewing.

- Developed a system to support MR (Mixed Reality) medical diagnosis.

**Interactive Multi-user Medical Visualization and Immersive Volume Rendering**, May. *2021 - Dec. 2021*

*Data-Driven XR Visualization Group, Nanjing Normal University* 

*Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Richen Liu*

- Optimized a ray-casting algorithm and then deployed the derived algorithm to immersive environments for 3d medical volumetric data interpretation;

- Implemented a track seeding algorithm (based on the continuous scale space theory) to facilitate 2D to 3d imaging migration;

- Generated 3D textures from the seeding algorithm subsequent to multi-user interactions and then tested multi-user rendering of 3D volumetric data in an immersive environment.
